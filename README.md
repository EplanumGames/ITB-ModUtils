# Into the Breach Mod Loader

A mod loader for the game Into the Breach, written in Lua, and with extension .dlls for some additional features. Originally created by Cyberboy2000, who has unfortunately been absent and unreachable for extended periods of time.

## Installation

Extract the zip file into the game's base directory, overwriting files as necessary. The zip includes original copies of the overwritten files so you can easily revert, if need be.

If you're upgrading from a previous version of the modloader and encounter issues, the nuclear option of doing a clean reinstall of the game will solve all of them. If not, come ask your question either on [Into the Breach Discord server in `#modding` channel](https://discord.gg/trrNB6p), or [on the forums](http://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=32833).
